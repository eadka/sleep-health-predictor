# Sleep Health Predictor
A machine learning project analyzing how **lifestyle habits** like stress, BMI, and screen time influence **sleep quality and disorders**.


## Project Overview
This project uses the [Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset) to:
- Explore relationships between lifestyle factors and sleep quality.
- Predict the presence of a **sleep disorder** using ML models.
- Build an interpretable, deployable prediction pipeline.


## Dataset
**Source:** Kaggle — [*Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset) 

The dataset is imported from the above source into the [data](https://github.com/eadka/sleep-health-predictor/tree/main/data) folder
and saved as sleep_health_lifestyle.csv.

**Features include:**
- `Sleep Duration`, `Stress Level`, `Physical Activity Level`, `BMI`, `Screen Time`, <<<fill here>>>
- Target: `Sleep Disorder` (binary classification)

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**


2. **Feature Engineering**


3. **Model Training** – Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.


4. **Model Evaluation** – ROC AUC, feature importance


5. **Deployment** – FastAPI app + Docker container
