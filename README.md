</p>

A machine learning project analyzing how **lifestyle habits** like stress, BMI, and exercise influence **sleep quality**.


## Project Overview
This project uses the [Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset) to:
- Explore relationships between lifestyle factors and sleep quality.
- Predict **sleep quality** using ML models.
- Build an interpretable, deployable prediction pipeline.


## Dataset
The [*dataset*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset) is imported into the [data](https://github.com/eadka/sleep-health-predictor/tree/main/data) folder and saved as *sleep_health_lifestyle.csv*.


**Features include:**
- `Age`, `Gender`, `Occupation`, `Blood Pressure`, `Stress Level`, `Heart Rate`, `Physical Activity Level`, `Daily Steps`, `BMI`, `Sleep Duration`, `Sleep Disorder`
- Target: `Quality of Sleep` 


## Workflow
The dataset analysis and the models training were conducted in Jupyter Notebook. You can find it in the file named [sleep-health-predictor-notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/eadka/sleep-health-predictor/blob/main/notebooks/sleep-health-predictor-notebook.ipynb).

Following steps were performed in this notebook.

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
2. **Feature Engineering**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

### 🧠 Insights Summary

Overall, <b>sleep duration</b> and <b>stress level</b> emerge as the most influential factors affecting sleep quality.  
While longer sleep and regular physical activity tend to enhance rest quality, elevated <b>stress</b>, <b>heart rate</b>, and <b>blood pressure</b> correspond with poorer sleep outcomes.  

💡 Maintaining a <b>balanced lifestyle</b> — combining adequate rest, consistent exercise, and stress management — can meaningfully improve overall sleep quality.

4. **Model Training** – Models trained are: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso, Decision Trees, Random Forest and XGBoost


5. **Model Evaluation** – **Grid Search** along with **Cross Validation** are used to tune the hyperparameters to ensure we enable better parameter interactions and get more robust results. **R²**, **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) and **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) are used to assess the results.

The below table shows the results of the **Baseline** and **Tuned** models. 

| Model                 | R² (Baseline) | RMSE (Baseline) | MAE (Baseline) | R² (Tuned) | RMSE (Tuned) | MAE (Tuned) |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Linear Regression** | 0.966         | 0.255           | 0.153          | 0.963      | 0.264        | 0.161       |
| **Ridge Regression**  | 0.964         | 0.261           | 0.166          | 0.957      | 0.286        | 0.193       |
| **Lasso**             | 0.044         | 1.348           | 1.189          | 0.954      | 0.295        | 0.205       |
| **Decision Tree**     | 0.986         | 0.163           | 0.027          | 0.967      | 0.250        | 0.077       |
| **Random Forest**     | 0.979         | 0.200           | 0.059          | 0.983      | 0.178        | 0.050       |
|🥇**XGBoost**         | 0.980         | 0.194           | 0.031          | 0.985      | 0.171        | 0.055       |


**XGBoost** achieved the **highest R²** (0.985) and **lowest RMSE** (0.171) among all tuned models, indicating it’s the **most robust** model for predicting `quality_of_sleep`.

6. **Deployment** – Flask + Streamlit + Docker container


#### Build the Docker image

```
docker build -t sleep-predictor .
```


#### Run the container

```
docker run -p 9696:9696 sleep-predictor
```

You should see logs like:

```
[2025-11-06 07:45:22 +0000] [1] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 21.2.0
[2025-11-06 07:45:22 +0000] [1] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:9696 (1)
...
```

#### Test the endpoint:
In another terminal, test the app with an example sleep data:
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "gender": "Female",
    "age": 57,
    "occupation": "Nurse",
    "sleep_duration": 8.2,
    "physical_activity_level": 75,
    "stress_level": 3,
    "bmi_category": "Overweight",
    "heart_rate": 68,
    "daily_steps": 7000,
    "systolic": 140,
    "diastolic": 95,
    "sleep_disorder": "Sleep Apnea"
  }' \
  http://localhost:9696/predict
```

#### Result
You should get back JSON like:

```
{
  "sleep_prediction": 7.4,
  "sleep_quality": "Good"
}
```


### StreamLit
Alternatively you can run the stream lit app to alter the input parameter and get a prediction on the sleep quality.
To run the **StreamLit** app, in a terminal, run the below command:
```
 pipenv shell
 cd notebooks/
 streamlit run app.py
 ```

Open the StreamLit app in a browser or go to **Ports** and open **8501** or the port mapped for the StreamLit app.

</p>

Add in the data and click on **Predict Sleep Quality** button to see the sleep quality prediction.

### Cloud deployment with **fly.io**
The Flask service is fully Dockerized and deployed to Fly.io, providing a secure and scalable cloud endpoint for predictions.
